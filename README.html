# Hello World

This script is a oneliner that renders a HTML document that contains markdown as HTML.

This is **bold** and this is *italic*.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

```javascript
console.log("markdown rendered!");
```

Check the source code of this HTML. You'll be surprised.

I hope that at some point in the future, browsers will build this in.
